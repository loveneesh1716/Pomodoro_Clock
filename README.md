# Pomodoro_Clock
  The Pomodoro Technique will provide a simple tool/process for improving productivity (your <b>own</b> and that of your <b>team</b> members) <br>
  
  * It's a time management method that can be used for any task. <br>
  * For many people, time is an enemy. The anxiety triggered by “the ticking clock”, especially when it involves a deadline, leads to ineffective work and study habits which in turn   lead to procrastination.

## Why?
To use time as a valuable in accomplishing what we want to do in the way we want to do it, and to enable us to improve continually the way we work or study.

* Start the Pomodoro timer
* Work until the Pomodoro stops
* Take a short break (5-10 minutes)
